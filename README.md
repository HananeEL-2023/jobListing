## My process

### Built with

- Tailwindcss
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This marks my second experience with Tailwind CSS, and I've found myself growing more confident with its usage. I've also picked up some new tips along the way. As for React, I employed the useState and useEffect hooks. Familiarity with these hooks made the process feel quite seamless, as I had already worked with them before.
